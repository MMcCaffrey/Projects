# Projects
### Just a place to put various personal projects I'm working on.  

Currently, I am focused entirely on finishing my [Capstone Project](https://github.com/MMcCaffrey/GalvanizeCapstone) for the [Galvanize Data Science Immersive](https://new.galvanize.com/austin/data-science) program and returning to the Land of Happily Employed People. So I'm not doing a whole lot on the projects listed here right now. And by "not a whole lot," I mean, of course, jackdiddilysquadoosh.

So for now this space serves as a holding area for ideas and datasets I'd like to explore later. 

Thanks for understanding...
