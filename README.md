# Projects
Just a place to put various personal projects I'm working on.  

Currently, my time is pretty much entirely spent on finishing my [Capstone Project](https://github.com/MMcCaffrey/GalvanizeCapstone) for the [Galvanize Data Science Immersive](https://new.galvanize.com/austin/data-science) program and returning to the Land of Happily Employed People. So I'm not doing a whole lot on these projects right now. *However,* I am using this area as an organizational space for ideas and datasets for future exploration. 

Thanks for understanding...
