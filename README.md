# Portfolio of Data Science & Programming Projects

OK, bear with me, I'm gonna try something a little different here. This repo will only have this ReadMe file, with hyperlinks to other GitHub repos for various projects. This way I get to feature a single "repo" on my GitHub profile for visitors (*cough cough* **prospective employers**) to check out, but if anybody wants to fork or clone anything in particular, they can do so without getting everything else.
  
I dunno. We'll see how it goes.
  
### [An Exploratory Analysis of NFL Play-by-Play Data, 2009-2016](https://github.com/MMcCaffrey/GalvanizeCapstone)

Imagine you're the Defensive Coordinator for an NFL team. What type of play will the opposing team try next? Will they pass? Will they run? Predicting this has immense value for deploying a defensive counter-play. Of course, that Offensive Coordinator across the field wants to deceive you, making for quite the adversarial process.

This was my Capstone Project for the [Galvanize Data Science Immersive](https://new.galvanize.com/austin/data-science) program, which I completed in March 2017.

### [Algorithms](https://github.com/MMcCaffrey/Algorithms)
I'm working my way through a couple of algorithm texts, starting with [*Algorithms Illuminated*](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Illuminated-Part-1-Basics-ebook/dp/B075YQP38X/), by [Tim Roughgarden](http://theory.stanford.edu/~tim/) (2017). I'm also using this repo as a place to store various snippets of helpful (or at least interesting) code.
